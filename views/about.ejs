            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey There 🫶 I'm Giorgia, a 26-year-old Italian 🤌 who has called Malta 🇲🇹 home since 2016. My professional journey began in iGaming, where I honed my expertise in customer service and digital marketing, mastering skills such as <strong>SEO</strong>, <strong>website optimization</strong>, and <strong>strategic planning.</strong>
            Despite my success in the iGaming industry 🎮, I found myself yearning for a more fulfilling career path 🌅. This realization led me to resign and embark on a transformative journey of self-discovery. Over the past 8 months, I've dived deep in the world of <strong>Graphic Design</strong>, <strong>Web Design</strong>, <strong>UX/UI Design</strong>, and <strong>Web Development</strong> completing various courses on platforms like <u>Udemy</u> and <u>Coursera.</u>
            Visit my <a href="https://www.giorgiacorsetti.com" class="plain-link">creative portfolio</a> if you're curious to know what I achieved!
            Beyond my professional pursuits, I absolutely love <u>painting</u> 🎨, <u>drawing</u> ✏️, <u>gardening</u> 🪴 and delving into <u>psychology books</u> 📚 during my free time. I also like to be involved in voluntary initiatives related to mental health support, environmental restoration, and preservation. Nature holds a special place in my heart and I often find peace in walks, considering it a therapeutic escape from the distractions of society.
            Now equipped with a wealth of knowledge from these courses, I am eager to showcase my skills and contribute remotely. Let's connect and explore the possibilities of collaboration!💜💜💜💜💜</p>
